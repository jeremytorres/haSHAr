File verification should:\r\n\r\n- Utilize the latest performance-enhanced libraries within OSX, e.g., Grand Central Dispatch [(GCD)] [1] and async file I/O;\r\n- Be based on a cryptographically-strong message digest algorithm, e.g., [SHA1] [2]\r\n- Provide a simple, human-readable side-car file containing the hash of the file.  For example, file \"MyFile.txt\" would have a corresponding \"MyFile.txt.sha1\" side-car containing a hex-encoded string.\r\n\r\nOther goals include:\r\n  - Share with the open source developer community;\r\n  - Aid in a learning opportunity;\r\n\r\nContact:\r\nphotog.jt@gmail.com\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Current Status ###\r\n\r\nThere are two (2) build targets for XCode 4:\r\n\r\n- __CLI__: for command line execution\r\n\r\nThe CLI target is fully functional and can be use to generate/verify files based on file extensions.\r\n\r\n- __haSHAr___: GUI control\r\n\r\nThe haSHAr GUI target is a _Work in Progress_.
