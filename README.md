HaSHAr
---------------

The overall design goal of HaSHAr is to provide a simple-to-use file verification tool for use on Mac OSX.  File verification should:

  - Utilize the latest performance-enhanced libraries within OSX, e.g., Grand Central Dispatch [(GCD)] [1] and async file I/O;
  - Be based on a cryptographically-strong message digest algorithm, e.g., [SHA1] [2]

Other goals include

  - Share with the open source developer community;
  - Aid in a learning opportunity;
